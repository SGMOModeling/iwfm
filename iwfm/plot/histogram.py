def histogram(data, name, unit, file, method='auto'):
    """
    histigram() - Create a histogram of given data and determine the number of bins.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : list or array-like
        The dataset for which the histogram is to be created.

    method : str, optional
        Method for determining the number of bins. Options include:
        - 'auto': Automatically select an appropriate number of bins (default).
        - 'sturges': Use Sturges' rule to determine the number of bins.
        - 'sqrt': Use the square root rule to determine the number of bins.
        - 'rice': Use Rice's rule to determine the number of bins.
        - 'scott': Use Scott's rule to determine the number of bins.
        - 'fd': Use the Freedman-Diaconis rule to determine the number of bins.

    Returns
    -------
    histogram : array
        The histogram values, representing the frequency of data in each bin.

    bins : int
        The determined number of bins for the histogram.
